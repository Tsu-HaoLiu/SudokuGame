# SudokuGame

Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.

#### Rules of Sudoku


1. You can only use numbers 1-9.
2. Numbers cannot be used more than once in a single row/column/3x3.
